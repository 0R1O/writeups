This challenge can still be completed without actually using the included `.sql` file to create a MySQL database, but... you will need this database for future challenges.

Simply open the file in your favourite text editor and search for some string like `LUCI` ... you'll find a user with a firstname of `Lucia`. Simply looking at their email will give you the flag: `flag{luc1afer.h4vr0n@shallowgraveu.com}`
