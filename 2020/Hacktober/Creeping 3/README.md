For claiming to be part of a hacker group as dangerous as DEADFACE, I'm surprised how much sensitive information Ali posts online. Based on the information you've been able to gather on Ali Tevlin, what date was he born?

Submit the flag in the following format: flag{dd mmm yyyy}.

Once again - simply use the facebook page. (Reading the [previous writeups](../Creeping%202/README.md) is probably helpful as well).

This time, you will probably need to log into facebook, or create an account, though. Then, simply take a look at the `About -> Contact and basic info` page.

The flag is: `flag{17 JUN 1973}`
