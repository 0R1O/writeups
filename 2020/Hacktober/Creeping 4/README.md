Ali Tevlin went on vacation in August. Based on his social media activity, which town did he stop in first? Submit the flag as flag{City, State}.

Example: flag{Albany, NY}
```

Once again on Mr. Tevlin's facebook page, you can find a picture of him standing in front of some statue in August.

A google image search will reveal that this is a mothman statue in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

The flag therefore is: `flag{Point Pleasant, WV}`
