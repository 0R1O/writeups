Our good friend Yeltsa Kcir ordered a flag for us from the renowned flag delivery service. We got their letter today, but we canâ€™t see the flag they sent us. Apparently Yeltsa has been talking with the scientist Odec Esrom. Can you find the flag he hid for us?

`Yeltsa Kcir` is spelling names backwards. It means `rick astley` 

So `Odec Esrom` would spell `Morse Cedo` => Morse Code? 

After some trial and error, we found out, that `D` is long and `?M6` is short. We wrote a little Python Script [solve.py](./solve.py)

Pasting the output into CyberChef:
