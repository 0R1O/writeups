```txt
Reply will once again be hosting its Reply Cyber Security Challenge, a team competition open to both students and professionals aged 16+. The online challenge will take place on Friday October 9th 2020 at 19:30 CEST and will last 24 hours.

>>> Your team can have 2 - 4 people. Registrations will close on Friday October 9th 2020 14:00 CEST! <<<

After the second edition last year, in which over 6,690 people from 87 countries around the world took part, the 2020 challenge will present five stimulating issues for each of the following categories: coding, web, miscellaneous, crypto and binary. The team that solves the security problem in a 'capture the flag' (CTF) contest will obtain the highest score in the challenge and win the challenge.

Designed by the Keen Minds team, Reply's cyber security experts, the Cyber Security Challenge is just one of a number of Reply initiatives to promote the culture of coding, with a particular focus on new generations.
